# What is the Density Succession Extension?

The Density Succession extension is based on the forest succession and dispersal module developed for [LANDIS PRO](https://cafnrfaculty.missouri.edu/gislab/landis/). Density Succession utilizes a cohort structure that carries stem densities for each individual age cohort across all species on each active cell. In addition to the cohort stem density information, the diameter breast height (DBH) of a given cohort of a species is simulated over time with a user-defined diameter growth model. With the number of trees and the DBH for each age cohort, common stand metrics including density, basal area, dominance, and importance can be determined in both relative and absolute terms. This design makes it possible to estimate available growing space, which is used to regulate seedling establishment and self-thinning, two key stand dynamic processes previously omitted in forest landscape models.
